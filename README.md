Prep for a tech talk on Java unit testing frameworks

Trying to start Tech Talks at work.. Wanted the first one to be on Unit Testing .. Wanted to introduce folks to some mocking frameworks in Java via toy examples .. The idea is to follow this up by taking a use case in our real code base (which is in our internal repo) and use these mocking techniques to understand how to read code .. 

Ideas taken from Michael Feathers's "Working Effectively with Legacy Code", however using Mocking libraries like easymock, mockito and jmockit.
